N2CMS.Baseline

This is package that should make your life as a N2CMS developer easier. Idea is to
quickly set up new project and get you going.

How to use it?
Since initial installation of MVC project has many things that are not needed, this
package will install only core MVC assemblies and set up minimal configuration.
Just create empty MVC project in VS and install package
